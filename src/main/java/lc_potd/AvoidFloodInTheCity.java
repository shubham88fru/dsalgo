     The problem description is a bit confusing.
     The idea is that at every 0 we need to check
     if a lake had already rained, if so, clear it.
     Because if the same lake rains again, it will flood.

     I had a good enough understanding of the problem and
     a potential solution, but couldn't conceive a concrete soln.
     Following soln is coded by me based on LC's official soln.
     There is aparently a priority queue soln as well.

         This is BS.
         Even if there wasn't any lake really that needed to
         be cleared on a 0 day, the problem needs to return some
         lake value there, can't return 0.

         For e.g. for input [69,0,0,0,69]
         Answer should be [-1,69,1,1,-1]
         and not [-1,69,0,0,-1]

         For input [0,0,0,0]
         Answer should be [1, 1, 1, 1] ðŸ¤¯
         not [0, 0, 0, 0]
