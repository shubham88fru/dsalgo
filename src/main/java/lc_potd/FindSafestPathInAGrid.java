         At this point, we have a matrix (distToTheif) which is populated
         with the min distance to its nearest theif. All that we need to
         do now is to start a probe. The probe does the following:
         1. Chooses a possible value of the max safe distance.
         2. Check if we can find a path with that safe distance.
         3. If we can, then we become more ambitious and try to find a path
         with a higher max safe distance.
         else if not, then we try with a lower max safe distance.
         Aim is the find the max possible safe distance for which a path from (0, 0) to (n-1, n-1) exists.
         Note that the min possible max safe distance is zero (a path that passes
         through a theif). And the max possible max safe distance is `len` (which
         at this point will be the max dist from a theif location).
         Optimization: We know that if a max safe distance x (belonging [0, len]) is not possible,
         then there's no point checking any distance between [x+1, len] since they won't be possible
         either. Similarly, if a max safe distance x is possible, then there's no point checking
         any distance between [0, x-1] because we have to return the max possible max safe
         distance. Hence, we can apply a bianry search over the range of possible max
         safe distances to make the search faster.
