                     People are boasting in the comments
                     that the following formula was taught
                     in school. Not sure if I'm old enough
                     to remember, but can't recollect seeing
                     or applying this formula ever in my life.

                     Shoelace's formula is used to find the are of
                     triangle formed by any 3 given points -
                     Area = (1/2) * |x1 * (y2 - y3) + x2 * (y3 - y1) + x3 * (y1 - y2)| ðŸ¤¯
                     */
                    double area = 0.5*(Math.abs(x1*(y2-y3) + x2*(y3-y1) + x3*(y1-y2)));
                    maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, area);
                }
            }
        }

        return maxArea;
    }
