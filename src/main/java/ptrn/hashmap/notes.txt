- Because different keys may hash to the same index (collision), hashmaps typically
include a collision resolution strategy. Common methods include:
    1. Chaining: Collision resolution strategy where each slot in the hash table
       contains a linked list of entries that hash to the same index.
    2. Open addressing: Collision resolution strategy where collisions are resolved
       by probing through the hash table to find an empty slot, typically using methods
       like linear probing or quadratic probing.
