- The topological sort pattern is used to find valid orderings of elements that have dependencies on,
  or priority over each other. Scheduling and grouping problems that have prerequisites or dependencies
  generally fall under this pattern.

- Topological sort is used to find a linear ordering of elements that have dependencies on or priority over each other.

 - With the topological sort pattern, converting a problem to a directed graph is the first step to finding a solution.
   The elements to consider correspond to graph vertices and the dependency relationships form the edges.

 - A valid topological order exists if the graph is acyclic

 - scheduling a perfect example of the topological sort pattern.
