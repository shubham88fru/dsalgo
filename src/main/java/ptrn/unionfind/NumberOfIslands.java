    /**
     To recap, the solution to this problem can be divided into the following three parts:

         1. Count all occurrences of cell 1s in the grid.

         2. Traverse the grid and if a cell 1 is encountered,
         perform the union operation between the neighboring cell
         1s to connect them into a single component.

         3. Decrement count by 1 only if the current element and its
         neighboring cell 1s arenâ€™t already part of a connected component.
