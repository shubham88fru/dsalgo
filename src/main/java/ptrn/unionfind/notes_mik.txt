------------------------------

- What are Disjoint sets?
    A group of N sets whose intersection in null. i.e. each element exclusively belongs
    to only one set.
    e.g. a collection containing oranges, mangoes and apples when grouped will form 3 disjoint
    sets of Oranges, Mangoes and Apples.

- DSU is all about two operations: Union and Find.

- We initially assume each element of the collection form a separate group. Therefore, each
group has one element and that element itself is the leader of the group. The idea with DSU's `union()`
function is to take two groups and see if they can be merged to one, thereby decreasing the num of
groups and also updating the parent/leader of such merged group.
Note that the `union()` function is called on two elements, and for each element we find their current
group leader/parent (the root nodes) and perform merge on the graphs represented by each roots. Note by
merging we simply mean moving one root node as the child of another, so that one of the root's parent now
becomes the other root node.
A root node/leader node/parent node is that node which is parent of itself. Note that by this definition,
each element at the start is a root/parent/leader node.

- As for the `find()` function, the idea is that given an element of the collection, return the group or
the parent/leader of the group that the element belongs to. If after performing the find operation on say two
nodes, we realize that find returns the same node as the parent of both, then we can claim that the two nodes
belong to the same set.

- Methodology:
    - We start with two arrays - elements and parents. Each of size n.
    - The elements array represents each element of the collection and the corresponding
    position in the parents array represents the parent of the group that the element belongs to.

- Path compression and Rank:
    - Basically, the goal of Path compression and Rank is to shorten the graph in each group. Rank and path compression
    work together to compress the graph as much as possible.
    - In path compression, we improve the performance of the `find()` operation by compressing the long graphs.
    Basically, instead of forming a chain where each node has a child node and so on.. for a group, we make
    all the child nodes point directly to the root/leader/parent of that group instead of pointing to their
    respective parents.
    - The goal of ranking is similar too. Here we assign an initial rank of zero to all nodes. During union
    of two nodes, if the rank of the leader nodes of two nodes being merged is same, then choose any leader node
    as a parent and merge the other one as a child, while increasing the rank of the node that was chosen as parent by one.
    Otherwise, choose the parent node whose rank is higher as the the parent and merge the other node as a child.

 - Path Compression and Size:
    - Idea is very similar to Path compression and rank.
    - Differences are:-
        - Instead of maintaining a rank array, we maintain a size array.
        - While all ranks were initialized to zero, all sizes are initialized to 1.
        - During merge, we still check if sizes of the two parties are same, if same, then we make the
          one with larger size as the parent or if the sizes are different, then we choose the one with
          larger size as the parent. However, the difference is that when incrementing the size of
          the parent after merge, unlike path compression and rank, we don't just increment the size by 1,
          rather we increment the size by the size of the child that is being merged. Moreover, we increment the
          size in all scenarios after merge (recall that in path compression and rank, we only increment the rank by
          1 that too when the ranks were same).
        - In a way, the rank represented the height of the graph, while size kind of represents the number of nodes
          in the graph.
