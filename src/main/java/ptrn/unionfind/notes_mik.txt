- What are Disjoint sets?
    A group of N sets whose intersection in null. i.e. each element exclusively belongs
    to only one set.
    e.g. a collection containing oranges, mangoes and apples when grouped will form 3 disjoint
    sets of Oranges, Mangoes and Apples.

- DSU is all about two operations: Union and Find.

- We initially assume each element of the collection form a separate group. Therefore, each
group has one element and that element itself is the leader of the group. The idea with DSU's `union()`
function is to take two groups and see if they can be merged to one, thereby decreasing the num of
groups and also updating the parent/leader of such merged group.
Note that the `union()` function is called on two elements, and for each element we find their current
group leader/parent (the root nodes) and perform merge on the graphs represented by each roots. Note by
merging we simply mean moving one root node as the child of another, so that one of the root's parent now
becomes the other root node.
A root node/leader node/parent node is that node which is parent of itself. Note that by this definition,
each element at the start is a root/parent/leader node.

- As for the `find()` function, the idea is that given an element of the collection, return the group or
the parent/leader of the group that the element belongs to. If after performing the find operation on say two
nodes, we realize that find returns the same node as the parent of both, then we can claim that the two nodes
belong to the same set.

- Methodology:
    - We start with two arrays - elements and parents. Each of size n.
    - The elements array represents each element of the collection and the corresponding
    position in the parents array represents the parent of the group that the element belongs to.
